# ICIMS_Job_Reporter

This is a simple script that goes to a particular company's ICIMS job page and gets a list of the currently posted job. It then compares to the list of jobs from the previous run and sends a text message with the jobs that have been posted and taken down.

This is accomplished using Playwright and Twilio.
